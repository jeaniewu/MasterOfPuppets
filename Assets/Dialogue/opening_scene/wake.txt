“Goooood morning! How are you this fabulous day?”
. . . 
“Hm, yeah, I feel you hun, I hate mornings too."
"Especially when I find out that I’ve been kidnapped to play silly games of death and destruction." 
"All for the entertainment of some sexy disembodied voice.”
. . .
“Hahahaha! I’m joking of course!"
"It’ll be fine darling, you do just fine."
"Go ahead and take your time in this room to prepare and such."
"You can even use that mirror to get all…"
"DOLLED UP!” 
*snort* "My goodness, I just kill myself with that line everytime!”
